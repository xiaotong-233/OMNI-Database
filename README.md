# Oral Imaging for Malocclusion Issues Identification: Dataset, Deep Learning Models and Benchmark
## Introduction
This is the official code repo of *Oral Imaging for Malocclusion Issues Identification: Dataset, Deep Learning Models and Benchmark*.

In this project, 6 deep learning models were reproduced and evaluated, including three CNN-based models, two Transformer-based models, and one GNN-based model. In addition, we use these 6 widely used deep learning models as benchmarks, which have never been applied to automated diagnosis of malocclusion before. For a detailed description, please refer to our paper.

All benchmarked models are evaluated on: the OMNI Dataset.
